            <h1>
                Computer
            </h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry 
                out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations 
                (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic 
                computers can perform generic sets of operations known as 
                programs.These programs enable computers to perform a 
                wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally 
                complete computer that includes the hardware, operating 
                system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed 
                and used for full operation. This term may also refer to 
                a group of computers that are linked and function 
                together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
                <br>
                <br>
                Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual 
                instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since 
                ancient times.Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices 
                were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for 
                looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog 
                calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic 
                calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first 
                semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon- 
                based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip 
                technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the 
                volution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have 
                been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts 
                increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the 
                Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

            <p>
                Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of electrical engineering and 
                computer science that integrates several fields of computer science and 
                electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.
                <br>
                <br>
                Computer engineers not only require training in electronic 
                engineering, software design, and hardware-software integration, but also 
                in software engineering. It uses the techniques and principles of 
                electrical engineering and computer science, but also covers areas such as 
                artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer 
                architecture and operating systems. Computer engineers are involved in many 
                hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual 
                microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, 
                to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how 
                computer systems themselves work, yet it also demands them to integrate 
                into the larger picture.
                <br>
                <br>
                Robots are one of the applications of computer 
                engineering.
                <br>
                <br>
                Computer engineering usually deals with areas including writing software 
                and firmware for embedded microcontrollers, designing VLSI chips, designing 
                analog sensors, designing mixed signal circuit boards, and designing 
                operating systems. Computer engineers are also suited for robotics 
                research, which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and 
                monitor electrical systems like motors, communications, and sensors.

                operating system
            </h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API). In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>
                    Functions of an operating system
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    An operating system provides three essential capabilities: It offers a UI through a CLI or GUI; it launches and manages the application execution; and it identifies and exposes system hardware resources to those applications -- typically, through a standardized API.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <u>
                        UI.
                    </u>
                    operating system requires a UI, enabling users and administrators to interact with the OS in order to set up, configure and even troubleshoot the operating system and its underlying hardware. There are two primary types of UI available: CLI and GUI.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The CLI, or terminal mode window, provides a text-based interface where users rely on the traditional keyboard to enter specific commands, parameters and arguments related to specific tasks. The GUI, or desktop, provides a visual interface based on icons and symbols where users rely on gestures delivered by human interface devices, such as touchpads, touchscreens and mouse devices.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The GUI is most frequently used by casual or end users that are primarily interested in manipulating files and applications, such as double-clicking a file icon to open the file in its default application. The CLI remains popular among advanced users and system administrators that must handle a series of highly granular and repetitive commands on a regular basis, such as creating and running scripts to set up new personal computers (PCs) for employees.
                    <br>
                </p>    
                <br>
                <h1>
                    Application management
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    An operating system handles the launch and management of every application. This typically supports an array of behaviors, including timesharing multiple processes, or threads, so that various tasks can share the available processors' time; handling interruptions that applications produce to gain a processor's immediate attention, ensuring there is enough memory to execute the application and its corresponding data without interfering with other processes; carrying out error handling that can gracefully remove an application's processes; and performing memory management without disrupting other applications or the OS.
                    An operating system can also support APIs that enable applications to utilize OS and hardware functions without the need to know anything about the low-level OS or hardware state. As an example, a Windows API can enable a program to obtain input from a keyboard or mouse; create GUI elements, such as dialog windows and buttons; read and write files to a storage device; and more. Applications are almost always tailored to use the operating system on which the application intends to run.

            <p>
                Software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data.This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. As of 2023, most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, so computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.
                <br>
                <br>
                The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages. High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, which has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.

                Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

            <p>
                Machine language is a low-level language made up of binary numbers or bits that a computer can understand. It is also known as machine code or object code and is extremely tough to comprehend. The only language that the computer understands is machine language. All programmes and programming languages, such as Swift and C++, produce or run programmes in machine language before they are run on a computer. When a specific task, even the smallest process executes, machine language is transported to the system processor. Computers are only able to understand binary data as they are digital devices.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the computer, all data like videos, programs, pictures are represented in binary. The CPU processes this machine code or binary data as input. Then, an application or operating system gets the resulting output from the CPU and displays it visually. For example, the ASCII code 01000001 represents the letter "A" in machine language, yet it is shown on the screen as "A".

                A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.
                <br>
                <br>
                The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

                Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

            <p>
                The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system memory. A program written in C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an executable that a computer can run. Many versions of Unix-based operating systems (OSes) are written in C and it has been standardized as part of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX).
                <br>

                Today, the C programming language runs on many different hardware platforms and OSes such as Microsoft and Linux.

            <p>
                C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
                <br>
                <br>
                C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
                <br>
                <br>
                The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

                C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
                <br>
                <br>
                C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
                <br>
                <br>
                C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                <br>
                <br>
                C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                <br>
                <br>
                C++ is fun and easy to learn!
                <br>
                <br>
                As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
